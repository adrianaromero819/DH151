# Site Agenda 
The agenda of the site is to provide viewers with a colorful, interactive experience of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in light of the 2016 Olympics. The map offers illustration of important characteristics of Brazil and different representations of the Olympics (stadiums, athletes, etc). General facts about the Olympics and facts in the context of Brazil are available by hovering over different images, along with information about different controversies related to the Olympics. 

# Why It Speaks To Me 
I am incredibly intrigued with the different cultures and histories of countries, and I love to learn about Brazil. I remember watching both the World Cup and Olympics when they were hosted in Brazil. The 2016 Olympics was the first time I became exposed to the widespread controversies and scandals that often accompany large, expensive events like the Olympic. Coming to fathom the extreme financial obligations that countries must pay for the Olympics while their citizens lack basic services, such as adequate housing and access to water, was eye-opening and important to learn. I appreciate that the map includes details on controversies surrounding the Olympics rather than purely focusing on the event. I also enjoyed the illustrations and captions capturing different elements of the country.

# How does the mapping work, and does it work?
The map is animated by Fiasco Design, working as a representation of Rio. People can use their mouse to move across the animated map, and have the ability to zoom in and out. On the bottom left is a box that pinpoints Rio on a map, and when it is clicked on it sends the user to a link of Rio on Google Maps. Overall, I think the map does what is is supposed to do. It offers users opportunity to explore and discover numerous aspects of Rio and the Olympics through animated illustrations, sounds, and texts of information. 

# Technologies Used 
Google Maps, built using HTML5 and CSS3 animations according to awwwards.com

# Changes I Would Make 
A change I would make is I would have the map zoom out further than just what is illustrated in detail. There is never an opportunity to view the full illustration of the map, one is only allowed to view one portion at a time so you can never see the full image. I think it would be nice to be able to view the whole illustration, and it might make it more pleasing to navigate. I would also add some sort of indication about which images have a textbox with information when you click on it or hover over it. Because there is nothing that specifies what images have information paired with it, I found myself hovering around random details on the map to distinguish what images would give text.
