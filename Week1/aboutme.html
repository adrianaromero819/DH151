	<div class="intro">
		<p>Hello everyone! My name is <b>Adriana Romero</b>, and I am a 4th year at <b>UCLA</b> majoring in <b>Sociology</b> and minoring in <b>Public Affairs</b>. I transferred from <b>West Los Angeles Community College</b> in the fall of 2019. Although my university experience is not entirely what I expected it to be, I am grateful to have spent these past few years expanding and reforming my knowledge. </p> 
		<p>I have yet to determine what professional path I want to pursue, but I am interested in attending graduate school and either teaching Sociology at a community-college level or working in the field of urban planning. I am new to the world of digital humanities and working with spatial data, but I am passionate about dismantling systems that produce social disparities and advancing social justice. I am excited to approach the world of GIS and mapping in a way that intersects with all realms of human and environmental justice (health, climate change, racial equity, accessible housing, etc). I have a lot to learn, but I am <b>excited!</b> </p>
